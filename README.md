# CBAStage2
This repo contains a virtual environment, an app.py where all the code is contained, and a requirements.txt which contains a list of packages and/or libraries that need to be installed for the project to work.
I set up the MySQL database in through the MySQL terminal, and afterwards, it later appeared in my MySQL workspace.  The database is called 'storedata' and has a table named 'sales'.
The app.py connects to the database and interacts with it, being able to execute queries, read data, return it, and add rows to the table.  There are also two endpoints: one GET and one POST.  The GET endpoint allows the user to find a list of rows in the table between the range of two dates.  The POST endpoint allows the user to add a new row to the table.
